The extended test quality gate is for any test that you do not want to run on every commit e.g.

* Longer peak load tests
* Soak tests

Running these tests can be expensive and typically these are run once a day on the latest version of the application
that has been promoted from fast feedback.

These are typically based on Non-Functional-Requirements (NFRs) which should specify what’s the average load expected, peak traffic (both requests per second and concurrent users) and response times in the different percentiles.
To simulate processing time of a downstream application, a delay can be added on all integration endpoints.

## Types of test

### Peak Load Test

Taken from the peak traffic. These tests typically run for ~1h and ensure the application under peak traffic does not exceed the expected response times.

### Soak Test

Tests based on the average throughput from the NFRs. These tests typically run longer than peak, running from 4 h duration to a 24/7 environment. They are good to evaluate the stability of the system, catching any degradation of the system like memory leaks.

### Rolling Update

This test ensures that a new deployment is successful and doesn’t cause errors even when the ingress controller pods restart. To validate that, the test should ensure that it:

* Stops accepting new connections.
* Processes the inbound connection that it has already accepted.
* Exits after everything is processed with exit code 0.

### Resilience Tests

This type of test, like the name says, is used to test the resilience of the system. Taking the same example of the Ingress feature, we can use this to remove all pods in a certain availability zone and ensure that all requests are successful.

## How to use this on the pipeline?

These should be triggered by a cron on git actions, and the pipeline will look like:
![Extended-tests](/images/p2p/extended-tests.png)

## Usage

```yaml
name: Extended Test

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 22 * * *'

permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write

jobs:
  get-latest-version:
    uses: coreeng/p2p/.github/workflows/p2p-get-latest-image-extended-test.yaml@v1
    with:
      image-name: knowledge-platform

  extendedtests:
    needs: [get-latest-version]
    uses: coreeng/p2p/.github/workflows/p2p-workflow-extended-test.yaml@v1
    with:
      version: ${{ needs.get-latest-version.outputs.version }}
```

This task will get the latest version that's on the `/extended-test` registry and execute the extended tests. If these are successful, it will promote the image to `prod`.
