Additional Information about how the P2P works.

## Automatic GH Action authentication

As part of your [tenancy](../../app/tenancy) you define GitHub repos.

All of those repos get passwordless access to deploy to your namespaces and
any sub namespace you create.

### Requirements

In order to use this pipeline, you'll need to be a tenant of a Core Platform.

For any repo that wasn't created out of Core Platform templates, but you would like to follow a recommended p2p standard, please use [`corectl`](/corectl) as below:

```shell
corectl p2p env sync <app repository> <tenant> [flags]
```

If the repo was created by `corectl`, it will automatically set the required variables.

Having these, you're set to start deploying!

### GitHub Variables

P2P pipelines expect some GitHub Variables to be configured.
You can configure it either automatically using `corectl` or manually.

#### Automatically

You can automatically set/update variables using `corectl`:

```bash
corectl p2p env sync <app-repository> <tenant-name>
```

#### Manually

Create your environments with the following variables:

* `BASE_DOMAIN` e.g. `gcp-dev.cecg.platform.cecg.io`
* `INTERNAL_SERVICES_DOMAIN` e.g. `gcp-dev-internal.cecg.platform.cecg.io`
* `DPLATFORM` environment name from platform-environments e.g. `dev`
* `PROJECT_ID` project id from platform environments e.g. `core-platform-efb3c84c`
* `PROJECT_NUMBER` project number for the project id above

![Git Environments](/images/p2p/git-environments.png)

Usually you need at least two environments, e.g.

* `dev`
* `prod`

For an instance of the CECG Core Platform on GCP.

A single dev environment is enough for Fast Feedback.

Set the following repository variables (these may be set globally for your org):

* `FAST_FEEDBACK` to `{"include": [{"deploy_env": "dev"}]}`
* `EXTENDED_TEST` to `{"include": [{"deploy_env": "dev"}]}`
* `PROD` to `{"include": [{"deploy_env": "prod"}]}`

And specifically for your app set:

* `TENANT_NAME` as configured in your tenancy in platform environments
