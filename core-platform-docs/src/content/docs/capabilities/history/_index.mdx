The Core Platform is a full developer platform, usable out of the box, on GCP (see [roadmap](../roadmap/) for other cloud support) based on the lessons learned from CECG's consulting arm building large scale developer platforms at big enterprises.

The big project miletones were:

- **Inception**: initial agreement with initial beta customer to adopt the platform as we build it
- **Dev Onboarding**: unblocking developers with environments and pipelines
- **Full Onbaording**: guarantee that environments will be long-lived and not rebuilt
- **Production Ready**: ready for production worklods, CECG migrates its first production app onto its instance
- **Devex**: after production ready, focus on onboarding experience and operations with a new CLI

### 2023 Q3

The product was kicked off in August 2023. With the following milestones set based on:

- Unblocking app developers as soon as possible < 2 weeks
- Unblock app developers doing a full path to production < 3 months
- Prove out the operations model of a user platform operator deploying new versions
- Final set of long-lived environments in < 3 months
- Production ready in < 6 months

This was an aggressive set of milestones but achieveable given the engineers working on the Core Platform have built
developer platforms many times.

#### Dev Playground (Week 2)

- GCP environment up and running (light weight GCP landing zones)
- Each dev can have its own tenancy (namespace) to develop their own application
- Deploy and run apps in K8s cluster
- Reference applications including basic CI/CD

#### Dev Environment Not-Live (Month 1)

- Ability to access deployed services through a URL
- Resource utilisation and platform health monitoring

#### All Environments Not-Live (PreDev, Dev, Prod) (Month 3)

- DevOps engineer will be able to deploy platform upgrades and test changes before releasing them to developers and into production
- Platform metrics such as uptime and latency, exposed via dashboards and alerts
- Detect platform configuration issues
- Tenants will be able to view logs and custom metrics for their deployed applications

By the end of the quarter the following milestones were met:

- Dev Playground (Week 2)
- Dev Environment Not-Live (Month 1)

#### All Environments Live (PreDev, Dev, Prod) (Month 6)

### 2023 Q4

The following milestones were met on time:

- All Environments Not-Live (PreDev, Dev, Prod), including but not limited to:
  - [Cloud Access](/reference/accessing-cloud-infra/) - the ability for workloads to access cloud workloads outside of the platform securely without passwords
  - Slack integration for alerts
  - Consolidated Alerting Dashboard
  - Ingress - expose services over TLS

### 2024 Q1

The following milestones were met on time:

- All Environments Live (PreDev, Dev, Prod)
- CECG's first production workload running on its instance of the platform

The Core Platform is now ready for production.

### 2024 Q2

- A big focus on improving developer experience and introducing the Platform CLI CoreCtl
- Autoscaling!
- Tenant monitoring stack
- Tenant support for using k6 for load testing

### 2024 Q3
