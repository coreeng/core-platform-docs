Before you get started setup the [Core Platform CLI](./corectl).

Deploying an application to the Core Platform consists of:

- Onboarding to the platform? (e.g. a new team, service, department). See [Adding a tenancy](./app/tenancy)
- Already onboarded? Jump to [Deploying a new application](./app/new-app)
- Ready for full continuous Delivery. See [Implementing the P2P](./p2p)
