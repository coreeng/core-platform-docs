# Login Docker Hub

## Login to Docker Hub

### Why do I need this?

Docker Hub has [pull rate limits](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/). If you're not logged in, you will have a shared quota for those pulls which you will not control.
To avoid this you should be using either a team account or organization account to login as part of the `p2p-build` step in the Makefile.
By having your own account, you'll ensure only that you have your own quota that is not shared by anyone so you'll have more predictable limitations

### How to login

After you create an account, you'll need to have to create a [Personal Access Token](https://app.docker.com/settings/personal-access-tokens). You can follow that link or go to `Account Settings->Personal access token`.

You can then generate a new one with `Public Repo Read-only` Access permissions.

#### Configuring p2p

In order to use the the token, we'll create a new secret in GitHub and call it `DOCKERHUB_PAT`. You can also store the username there with `DOCKERHUB_USER`.
Then we'll modify our fast-feedback.yaml workflow to include that secret as an environment variable. Don't worry, this will still be encoded and treated as a secret

```yaml
fastfeedback:
  needs: [version]
  uses: coreeng/p2p/.github/workflows/p2p-workflow-fastfeedback.yaml@v1
  secrets:
    env_vars: |
      DOCKERHUB_USER=${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USER }}
      DOCKERHUB_PAT=${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_PAT }}
```

Now we need to jump over to the `Makefile` and locate our `p2p-build` task.

We'll create a new task `docker-login` and add it as a dependency to the `p2p-build`

```sh

.PHONY: p2p-build
p2p-build: docker-login build-docker ## Builds the service image and pushes it to the registry

.PHONY: docker-login
docker-login: # Login to docker
  echo $(DOCKERHUB_PAT) | docker login -u $(DOCKERHUB_USER) --password-stdin

```
