The Core Platform is a multi-tenant platform where each tenant gets their own segregated environments and P2P.

If you already have a tenancy you can jump to [new-app](./new-app) to deploy a new application.

## What is a tenant? 

A Tenancy is the unit of access to the Core Platform.
It contains a readonly and admin group and gives CI/CD actors
(GitHub Actions) access to a namespace and a docker registry for images.
Once you have a tenancy, you can add sub namespaces for all your application testing needs.

Tenants are organized in the tree structure. 
For each tenant, we create a [hierarchical namespace](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/hierarchical-namespaces).
It helps to organize resources and access.
Examples:
- share of resource quotas
- control access with network policies (give access to a tenant and all its children)
- share prometheus instance for tenant children

### Adding a tenancy

```shell
corectl tenant create
```

It will prompt you a series of questions about a new tenant. 
Once you fill the form, `corectl`
will create a PR in the Environments Repo with a new file for the tenancy.
Once the PR is merged, a configuration for the new tenant will be provisioned automatically.

You'll be prompted for:

* `name` - Name of your tenancy. Must be the same as your filename.
* `parent` - Name of the parent tenant or `root`. Note: `root` tenant is created implicitly.
* `description` - Description for your tenancy.
* `contactEmail` - Metadata: Who is the contact for this tenancy? 
* `costCentre` - Metadata: Used to split cloud costs. 
* `environments` which of the environments in Environments Repo you want to deploy to
* `adminGroup` - will get permission to do all actions in the created namespaces
* `readonlyGroup` - will get read-only access to the created namespaces

Groups need to be in the `gke-security-groups` group!

## Accessing your namespaces

Once the above PR that `corectl` creates is merged everyone in the groups will have access to the namespaces created for that tenancy.

If you access the cluster from the local machine, you need to connect to the cluster.
The easiest way to do this is using `corectl`:
```bash
corectl env connect <env-name>
```

For example, to check a namespace for a tenancy named `myfirsttenancy`:
```bash
kubectl get namespace myfirsttenancy
NAME             STATUS   AGE
myfirsttenancy   Active   30s
```

With the [Hierarchical Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/08/14/introducing-hierarchical-namespaces/) kubectl plugin.
```bash
kubectl hns tree myfirsttenancy
myfirsttenancy
├── [s] myfirsttenancy-dev
├── [s] myfirsttenancy-functional
└── [s] myfirsttenancy-nft

[s] indicates subnamespaces
```

> Note:
> those `myfirsttenancy-[dev|funcitonal|nft]` namespaces are [lightweight environments](#creating-additional-lightweight-environments).
> You might not have those in the output if you didn't create them.

> Note: Instruction for installing the `hns` plugin for `kubectl` can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/hierarchical-namespaces/releases)

## Creating additional lightweight environments

You have permission to create as many lightweight environments in your tenancy.

All reference apps create at least:

* functional - for stubbed functional tests 
* nft - for stubbed functional tests

Typically, all lightweight environments are created in your dev cluster and only
a single namespace per application is in production.

To create a lightweight environment, in your tenancy namespace create:


```
apiVersion: hnc.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: SubnamespaceAnchor
metadata:
  namespace: {tenant_name}
  name: your-lightweight-env
```

#### Manually raising a PR for a new tenancy

To add a tenancy raise a PR to the Environments Repo under `tenants/tenants/` in your platform enviornments repo.

Your tenancy name must be the same as the file name!

For example, if I want to create a tenancy with the name `myfirsttenancy`, then I will create a file named `myfirsttenancy.yaml` with the following structure:

```yaml
name: myfirsttenancy 
parent: sandboxes
description: "Go Application"
contactEmail: go-application@{{ email_org }}
costCentre: platform
environments:
  - gcp-dev
repos:
  - https://github.com/<your-github-id>/go-application
adminGroup: platform-accelerator-admin@{{ email_org }}
readonlyGroup: platform-readonly@{{ email_org }}
cloudAccess:
  - name: ca # Cloud Access. Keeping it short so the username is also short, biggest one will be ca-connected-app-functional which is 27 chars, for mysql 8.0 needs to be 32max. For 5.7 16 max
    provider: gcp
    kubernetesServiceAccounts:
    - <namespace>/<k8s_service_account_name>
infrastructure:
  network:
      projects:
      - name: name
        id: <project_id>
        environment: <platform_environment>
betaFeatures:
  - k6-operator
```


* `repos` - Your [application](./new-app) URL. All `repos` GitHub actions will get permission to deploy to the created namespaces for implementing your application's [Path to Production](../p2p) aka CI/CD
* `cloudAccess` - generates cloud-provider-specific machine identities for kubernetes service accounts to impersonate/assume. Note that the `kubernetesServiceAccounts` are constructed like `<namespace>/<kubernetesServiceAccount>` so make sure these match with what your application is doing. This Kubernetes Service Account is controlled and created by the App and configured to use the GCP service account created by this configuration.
* `infrastructure` - allows you to configure projects to be attached to the current one's shared VPC, allowing you to use Private Service Access connections to databases in your own projects. This will attach your project to the one on the environment.
* `betaFeatures` - enables certain beta features for tenants:
  * `k6-operator` - allows running tests with K6 Operator.

{{% notice note %}}
This attachment is unique, you can only attach your project to a single other project.
{{% /notice %}}
This means that if you want to have your databases in `gcp-dev` and `gcp-prod` for example, your tenant will need 2 GCP projects to attach to each environment.
