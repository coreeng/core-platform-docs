Before you get started setup the [Core Platform CLI](./corectl).

Deploying an application to the Core Platform consists of:

* Onboarding a tenancy (e.g. a team, service, department. See [Adding a tenancy](./tenancy)
* Already onboarded? Jump to [Deploying a new application](./new-app)
* Ready for full continuous Delivery. See [Implementing the P2P](../p2p)
