## Platform Ingress
Platform Ingress is reponsible for creating the Ingress setup.


## Design
{{< figure src="/images/platform-ingress/idp-connectivity.png" title="Ingress design" >}}

### What does it include?
* Public and Private access
* Cloud DNS managed zones to manage the DNS
* External DNS
* Traefik Ingress controller

## How does DNS work?

Out of the box we will provide a subdomain of `cecg.io`. If they have their own domain, that can be configured based on the `config.yaml`. The base construction will be:
`<environment>.<organization>.<ingressDomain>`, for example, `sandbox-gcp.cecg.cecg.io`. The private URL construction will be configurable on the environment config file, but we typically keep the same one with an `internal` suffix, like `sandbox-gcp-internal.cecg.cecg.io`

The platform-ingress module install a Gateway object that creates a GCP load balancer.  External DNS picks that up and registers them with A records with the LB IP. All other domains are registered as CNAME records pointing to the A records.

If they use our `cecg.io` domain, there is an additional step that needs to be done for DNS Delegation. Since we own the domain, when trying to resolve anytihing '*.cecg.io` it will hit our DNS managed zones. We can however delegate the resolution of certain subdomains to specific. See [DNS](../dns).


### DNS delegation
How can clients manage records on a subdomain they do not own? We need to create a DNS delegation.
For `cecg` for example, we'll need to delegate that subdomain to `cecg` client. 
To do that, all you need to do is to create a NS record with the nameservers on the managed zone the `cecg` client created.

### How can I differentiate between internal and external

There is a single ingress controller and load balancer. The way to differentiate is to use the ingress you configure in the environments config.yaml as internalService, for example `sandbox-gcp-internal.cecg.cecg.io`. Anything that hits that URL will be forward to the IAP for authentication and validations. Only people in the platform-readonly@<domain> google groups will be able to access that URL.
This means that everything is public because we do not use VPNs to access the cluster and always go through a public LB, but we can restrict the access using IAP.
For external DNS to work, each ingress will need to have the annotations
```
annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: reference-app.sandbox-gcp.cecg.cecg.io
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target: sandbox-gcp.cecg.cecg.io
```


## SSL
This will work out of the box until the LB using Let's Encrypt. It uses a single level certificate (eg. `*.sandbox-gcp.cecg.cecg.io`) which will allow users to create single level subdomain like `learn-functional.sandbox-gcp.cecg.cecg.io`. Any more levels won't work unfortunately.

## Example ingress
### External Ingress
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: reference-app-external
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: reference-app.sandbox-gcp.cecg.cecg.io
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target: sandbox-gcp.cecg.cecg.io
  namespace: golang-dev
spec:
  ingressClassName: platform-ingress
  rules:
  - host: reference-app.sandbox-gcp.cecg.cecg.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /hello
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: reference-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

### Internal Ingress
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: grafana
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: reference-app.sandbox-gcp-internal.cecg.cecg.io
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target: sandbox-gcp-internal.cecg.cecg.io
  namespace: platform-monitoring
spec:
  ingressClassName: platform-ingress
  rules:
  - host: reference-app.sandbox-gcp-internal.cecg.cecg.io
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: platform-grafana-service
            port:
              number: 3000
```

For more information on how to use this, please look at the [App Ingress section.](../app/ingress)

## Autoscaling

Platform Ingress scales automatically based on resource consumption to handle spikes of traffic.

[Horizontal Pod Autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) is enabled for Traefik pods and is configurable via `config.yaml`.

The following example overrides resource requests for Traefik pods, sets a range for the number of replicas 
and overrides the CPU usage percentage threshold.

```yaml
platformIngress:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "300Mi"
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 21
  cpuPercent: 80
```

## Future work
We aim to be tech agnostic and remove some redundancies, namely regarding external-dns annotations. For that we will create a mutating webhook that will inject the needed annotations based on the URL of the ingress. It will also check for conflicts in the configuration and block the creation of any already existing as that will cause the IC to load balance between 2 possibly completely distinct application
