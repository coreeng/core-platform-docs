Welcome to the [Core Platform](https://www.cecg.io/core-platform/) Documentation!

Core Platform is your ultimate all-in-one developer platform designed to turbocharge your software development journey from Day 1.

These docs assume you've already deployed a full set of Core Platform Environments. If you haven't 
please go to [Core Platform](https://www.cecg.io/contact-us/) to get in touch with us to set up
your environments.

## Getting started

- Learn more about how you can [Deploy Applications on Core Platform](../guides/deployapp/).

- Explore how to implement [Continuous Delivery](../p2p).

- Refer to [Platform Features](../platform) for operational guidance and best practices.
