The platform supports running wide range of workloads while keeping its base cost low. It provides autoscaling capabilities to adjust the capacity of the cluster to handle flucations in traffic. When the traffic goes down, the cluster reduces to normal size.

When running our platform on GCP/GKE we choose to operate clusters in [Standard mode](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/types-of-clusters#modes). 
You can read more about [pricing for Standard mode](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/pricing#standard_mode) clusters.
To generate a cost estimate based on your usage, use the [pricing calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator).

## Quotas

**By default, GCP applies `32` CPU quota per cluster**. Autoscaling won't be able to provision new nodes when quota is reached.
You may need to consider increasing the quota, so that you have enough resources to run your pods under peak loads.

## Node Pools

Platform and tenant pods run on worker nodes which are governed by node pools.

By default, we create a small node pool that runs platform system pods.
This pool will not be enough to run tenant workloads, so additional node pools need to be created via auto-provisioning and/or configured explicitly.

For GCP we recommend using [Node Auto-Provisioning](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/node-auto-provisioning) mode, so that GKE facilitates node pool scaling.

In special cases we allow Platform Operators to configure their node pools explicitly. This can be useful for a hybrid mode when general purpose nodes are provisioned automatically and there are additional node pools with special machine types to support CPU intensive workloads.

For the complete list of available machine types refer to Cloud Provider documentation, e.g. [Machine families resource and comparison guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource) for GCP.

### Default node pool

This is a small pool (1 node per zone) with `e2-standard-2` machine type.
By default, the platform system pods run there.

Assuming we are running a regional cluster with 3 zones, the minimal cost to operate the platform will be 3 nodes of `e2-standard-2` machine type.

### Scaling with Node Auto-Provisioning

Node Auto-Provisioning (NAP) is used to manage node pools.

NAP allows us to support workloads with various CPU and memory requests by creating node pools with optimal machine types.

In order to enable Node Auto-Provisioning you should specify:
- **number of CPU cores for the whole** cluster
- **number of gigabytes of memory for the whole** cluster
- **autoscaling profile**

Available autoscaling profiles:
- `BALANCED`: The default profile for Standard clusters that prioritises keeping resources available for incoming pods.
- `OPTIMIZE_UTILIZATION`: Prioritise optimizing utilization over keeping spare resources in the cluster. The cluster autoscaler scales down the cluster more aggressively. GKE can remove more nodes, and remove nodes faster.

More about [Autoscaling profiles](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/cluster-autoscaler#autoscaling_profiles).

The following examples enable Node Auto-Provisioning for the cluster via `config.yaml`:

- By default, GCE quota is 32, we use a 2vCPU VM for the bastion, so that's 30 cores left

```yaml
cluster:
  gcp:
    autoscaling:
      cpuCores: 30
      memoryGb: 200
```

- When GCE quota is raised to 64, we use a 2vCPU VM for the bastion, so that's 62 cores left

```yaml
cluster:
  gcp:
    autoscaling:
      cpuCores: 62
      memoryGb: 400
      profile: "OPTIMIZE_UTILIZATION"
```

### Explicit node pools configuration

This is discouraged, but available for users for which the default pool doesn't work.

Node pools need:
- machine type, e.g. `e2-standard-4`
- range for the number of nodes in the pool.
- optional taints and labels

{{% notice note %}}
We cannot explicitly define max CPU or memory for the node, we can do it only by choosing the proper machine type.
{{% /notice %}}

GKE automatically creates new nodes in the pool until it reaches their maximum count.
When limit is reached newly deployed pods will stay in Pending state waiting for resources to become available.

In specific cases it is possible to combine NAP with explicit node pools configuration. For example,
we may need machines with special capabilities. While having common workloads scheduled on auto-provisioned nodes,
we may have custom node pools that are managed explicitly.

The following is an example of a hybrid configuration providing a node pool with special capabilities:

```yaml
cluster:
  gcp:
    autoscaling:
      cpuCores: 50
      memoryGb: 120
    additionalNodePools:
      - name: "g2-pool"
        machineType: "g2-standard-4"
        minCount: 0
        maxCount: 2
        labels:
          gpu: "true"
        taints:
          - key: "gpu"
            value: "true"
            effect: "NO_SCHEDULE"
```

## Cluster Overprovisioning

### Problem

When tenants provision more replicas they may experience long delays between deploying a new Pod and actually running it. Provisioning of a new node takes time, it can be up to several minutes. This may not be an issue for a background job, but can definitely affect the performance of an API
that needs to scale quickly to be able to handle traffic spikes.

### Solution

### Overprovisioning
Can be configured using deployment running pause pods with very low assigned priority (see [Priority Preemption](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/)) which keeps resources that can be used by other pods.
If there is not enough resources then pause pods are preempted and new pods take their place.
Next pause pods become unschedulable and force CA to scale up the cluster.

For more details refer to [FAQ: How can I configure overprovisioning with Cluster Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-can-i-configure-overprovisioning-with-cluster-autoscaler).

### Platform Cost vs Autoscaling Speed

Cluster Overprovisioning will make the scheduling of new Pods faster, but may require additional costs. 

There is a choice between keeping the operational cost of the platform low and reserving additional resources for faster autoscaling.
