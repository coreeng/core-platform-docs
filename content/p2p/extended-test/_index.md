Extended tests, by default, run once a day and is the placeholder for longer running tests that are too slow
or expensive to run on every commit.

Implement the following Make targets:

* [p2p-extended-tests](/p2p/extended-test/p2p-extended-test/)
* [p2p-promote-to-prod](/p2p/extended-test/p2p-promote-to-prod/)

See [Types of extended tests](/p2p/reference/extended-tests/) for more information.
