# What is it?

Path to production (P2P) is the github workflows tool we provide for tenants to deploy their applications and can be found [here.](https://github.com/coreeng/p2p)

To learn more about it, check our [P2P documentation.](../../p2p/)

## Notes

We always update the major and minor version on new releases. We recommend using `v1` to avoid having to update on each version, as we'll ensure no breaking changes are introduced. You can also use the minor version to be slightly more strict as that one will also be overridden with the new version on each release, like `v1.1`.
