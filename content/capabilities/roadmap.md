This is the roadmap for features to be developed over the next quarter. It is always subject to change
based on the requirements of the current beta customers.

## 2024 Q4

### Cost Allocation

* See the cost of the base platform
* Cost break down per tenant (application)

### Developer Portal

* Onboard and discover capabilities
* Discover all applications from a single place

### Default Deny

* All traffic within an organisation denied by default, with self-service API for opening up firewalls between applications.

### Policy: Encode your standards into the platform

* Industry best practices encoded into the platform e.g. Docker best standards
* Ability for you to encode your own custom standards e.g. No services exposed over HTTP

### Transparent Encryption

* Full internal encryption for interservice traffic (Ingress is already TLS)

## 2025

Larger ticket items that will be prioritised as users request them.

### Multi Cloud Support

Feature parity across AWS and Azure.
