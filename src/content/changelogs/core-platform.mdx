### Breaking Change

In this version we are introducing changes to the default node pool configuration for GKE.

Previously, the following node pools were configured by default:

- `${ENV_NAME}-4-pool` (e2-standard-4, 0-5 nodes)
- `${ENV_NAME}-8-pool` (e2-standard-8, 0-5 nodes)
- `${ENV_NAME}-16-pool` (e2-standard-16, 0-5 nodes)

As we are introducing autoscaling with node auto-provisioning for GKE, we are no longer creating these node pools by default.

> ⚠️ This may cause downtime for your services as legacy node pools will be destroyed and it will take time to reschedule your Pods on the new node pools provisioned by autoscaling. To keep the existing node pools add them as described below. Note the `name` needs to match with the ones listed above.

For the non-disruptive migration you may explicitly define the node pools that are currently used by your workloads in the `config.yaml` file, e.g.:

```yaml
cluster:
  gcp:
    additionalNodePools:
      - name: "4-pool"
        machineType: "e2-standard-4"
        minCount: 0
        maxCount: 5
```

If you wish to gradually migrate your workloads away from legacy node pools, you may do this by applying taints:

```yaml
cluster:
  gcp:
    autoscaling:
      cpuCores: 20
      memoryGb: 80
    additionalNodePools:
      - name: "4-pool"
        machineType: "e2-standard-4"
        minCount: 0
        maxCount: 5
        taints:
          - key: "legacyPool"
            value: "true"
            effect: "PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE"
```
