# Enable Spot Instances


<Callout type="warning">

Spot instances are not recommended for running workloads that are not fault tolerant.

</Callout>

<Callout>

Spot works well if you need to cut down costs for your clusters. See [minimising costs](../minimise-costs).

</Callout>

## Cluster setup with minimal costs

Create a cluster with Spot instances, HDD disk and `e2-medium` disk type.

```yaml
cluster:
  gcp:
    additionalNodePools:
      - name: "spot-pool"
        machineType: "e2-medium"
        diskType: "pd-standard"
        minCount: 0
        maxCount: 5
        spot: true
# Nodepool with 5 VMs using standard will cost $162 per month

# Nodepool with 5 VMs using spot nodes will cost $61 per month
```
