# Managing Platform Environments


# Environments

The platform by default comes with a single organisation made up of three environments:

- **pre-dev**: Stage new versions of the platform before releasing to application engineers
- **dev**: Used for all development environments, functional testing, integrated testing, performance testing
- **prod**: Production

## Gcp init

The `gcp-init` tool comes bundled inside the platform docker image. From inside the image:

```shell
cd gcp-init
source .venv/bin/activiate
python gcp-init.py --help
```

## Creating an organisation

It is expected to have a single organisation, meaning one set of environments.

Before execute `core-platform-cli` we use any of the commands, we need to generate some Application Default Credentials (ADC):

```shell
gcloud auth application-default login
mv $HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json $HOME/.config/gcloud/Platform-user.json
```

This will generate JSON credentials for your user account, and move them to a file called `Platform-user.json` in the `gcloud` config directory. We'll use this file to authenticate as your user when running certain commands.

Before running `root-init`, we need to check some GCP permissions. Before we can initialize a "parent" (a GCP org or folder), we need the following:

- `roles/viewer` on the parent
- `roles/resourcemanager.folderCreator` on the parent
- `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator` on the parent

We can now run the `root-init` command from within the `core-platform-cli`:

```shell
PARENT_FOLDER=??? # e.g. folders/12345
BILLING_ACCOUNT=??? # e.g. 01BC90-344AF2-CED391
ENV_REPO=???  # e.g. e.g. {{ github-org }}/platform-environments
PLATFORM_ADMIN_GROUP=???
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/.config/gcloud/Platform-user.json \
python gcp-init.py root-init \
    --parent=$PARENT_FOLDER \
    --billing-account=$BILLING_ACCOUNT \
    --github-repos=$ENV_REPO \
    --impersonators=group:$PLATFORM_ADMIN_GROUP \
    --owners=group:$PLATFORM_ADMIN_GROUP
```

This script is **idempotent**, if you encounter Cloud API failures, you can generally re-run the command and it will only create the missing resources.

If the errors are that your user doesn't have permissions to do something, that probably won't be fixed by re-running

</Callout>

## Creating an environment

To be able to run the next step command (`gcp-init.py env-init ...`) we need to generate some new application credentials, allowing us to impersonate the `env-manager` service account from the previous step:

```shell
SA_EMAIL=$(jq -r .env_mgr_sa.email output-root_init.json)
gcloud auth application-default login --impersonate-service-account=$SA_EMAIL
mv $HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json $HOME/.config/gcloud/Platform-env-manager.json
```

This will generate JSON credentials for the service account, and move them to a file called `Platform-env-manager.json` in the `gcloud` config directory. We'll use this file to authenticate as the SA when running certain commands.

We can now extract some information from `output-root_init.json` to use as input to the `env-init` command:

```shell
ENV=??? # e.g. dev-2
PLATFORM_ADMIN_GROUP=???
ENV_REPO=???  # e.g. e.g. {{ github-org }}/platform-environments
BILLING_ACCOUNT=???
SHARED_FOLDER=$(jq -r .shared_folder.name output-root_init.json)
ENVIRONMENTS_FOLDER=$(jq -r .environments_folder.name output-root_init.json)
MANAGEMENT_FOLDER=$(jq -r .management_folder.name output-root_init.json)

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$HOME/.config/gcloud/Platform-env-manager.json \
python gcp-init.py env-init \
    --shared-folder=$SHARED_FOLDER \
    --environments-folder=$ENVIRONMENTS_FOLDER \
    --management-folder=$MANAGEMENT_FOLDER \
    --github-repos=$ENV_REPO \
    --impersonators=group:$PLATFORM_ADMIN_GROUP \
    --name=$ENV \
    --owners=group:$PLATFORM_ADMIN_GROUP \
    --billing-account=$BILLING_ACCOUNT
```

This will attempt to initialize an environment called `dev`, as before, the script is idempotent and can generally be re-ran in the face of errors until it has completed.
