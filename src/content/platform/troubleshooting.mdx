# Platform Troubleshooting

## Autoscaling failures

### 0/7 nodes are available: 7 Insufficient memory

```text
0/7 nodes are available: 7 Insufficient memory. preemption: 0/7 nodes are available: 1 Insufficient memory, 6 No preemption victims found for incoming pod.
```

Pods are stuck in `Pending` state.

Total memory requests for pods have exceeded the maximum memory that is allowed as part of node autoscaling in the
cluster.

#### Resolution

Update `config.yaml` to increase the memory limit of the cluster autoscaling. Example:

```yaml
cluster:
  gcp:
    autoscaling:
      cpuCores: 30
      memoryGb: 140
```

After the limits have been applied to the cluster, the pod should transition from `Pending` to `Running` state.

```

Pods are stuck in `Pending` state.

Total cpu requests for pods have exceeded the maximum cpu that is allowed for node autoscaling.

### Resolution

Update `config.yaml` to increase the cpu limit of the cluster autoscaling. Example:

```yaml
cluster:
  gcp:
    autoscaling:
      cpuCores: 60
      memoryGb: 140
```

## Node Imbalance

There are times where a node can be throttled e.g. 96% memory usage when other nodes have more than enough capacity to
accommodate extra workloads.

It is highly likely that pods running on that node do not have memory/cpu requests set. This causes kube scheduler to
place significant load on one node as it uses the requests to target what nodes pods should be placed on.

### Resolution

Set [resource requests](/reference/resources) for your application workloads to allow the kube scheduler better place
your pods on nodes with appropriate capacity. For example if you request 2Gi memory for your pod, the scheduler will
guarantee finding a node that has that capacity.

## Deployment Failures

### Local port [xxxx] is not available

A local port is used locally on the GitHub agent to IAP proxy to the Kubernetes API server.
Sometimes a randomly selected port is not available.

#### Logs

```text
2023-11-17T16:31:21.6142491Z --- Start tunnel (IAP)
2023-11-17T16:31:28.1159411Z ERROR: (gcloud.compute.start-iap-tunnel) Local port [57834] is not available.
```

#### Actions

The job can be re-run using re-run failed jobs

## Ingress / TLS Failures

### A new ingress domain is not working

When adding a new ingress domain the platform:

- Creates a Cloud DNS Managed Zone. You need to set up delegation for this domain so that Cloud DNS becomes the Name
  server.

### IPs not being allowlisted by traefik

You have configured to allowlist IPs using traefik middlewares but are still getting forbidden when accessing endpoints
from a valid IP address.

#### Enable JSON logs

Edit traefik deployment to add the arguments:

```yaml
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: traefik
  namespace: platform-ingress
---
spec:
  containers:
    - args:
        - --log.level=DEBUG
        - --log.format=json
        - --accesslog=true
        - --accesslog.format=json
```

#### View traefik logs

```yaml
kubectl logs -f deployment/traefik -n platform-ingress

Logs:

  { "level": "debug","middlewareName": "platform-ingress-ready-ipallowlist@kubernetescrd","middlewareType": "IPAllowLister","msg": "Accepting IP 86.160.248.78","time": "2024-08-07T22:03:23Z" }
```

##### Check Load Balancer logs

On the Google Console navigate to Logging Explorer navigate and run the following query

```sql
resource.type="http_load_balancer" resource.labels.project_id="<your-gcp-project-id>"
```

![Load Balancer Logs](/images/troubleshooting/loadbalancer_logs.png)

#### Actions

##### 1. Setup DNS Zone delegation for the new domain

See [dns delegation setup](./dns)

#### 2. Restart cert manager

Cert manager at times does not find the new Cloud DNS Zone. If this is the case you'll see cert manager logs like:

```text
E1124 04:28:57.742110       1 controller.go:167] "cert-manager/challenges: re-queuing item due to error processing" err="No matching GoogleCloud domain found for domain XXXX.XX." key="platform-ingress/ingress-tls-secure-1-2070261079-2597927957"
```

Restarting cert manager:

```shell
kubectl delete pods -n platform-ingress -l app=cert-manager
```

On restarting the error should go away. If not, raise a support ticket with the logs for:

- External-DNS
- Cert Manager
- Output from:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n platform-ingress
kubectl get certificates -n platform-ingress
kubectl get certificaterequests -n platform-ingress
kubectl describe gateway traefik -n platform-ingress
```

### NAT Gateway IP Allocation Failures

1. Are there not enough IPs allocated? Validate the root cause:

   1. Single service is keeping a lot of connections open

      1. Go to
         Grafana `platform-monitoring/NAT Gateway` dashboard and check:
         1. which VM's have unusual high open connections,
         2. which VM's have unusual high number of allocated ports
         3. correlate this information
            with `Network Received by Namespace` graph
            in `platform-monitoring/Kubernetes/Views/Global` dashboard on Grafana. To find namespace that uses most
            network bandwidth, then check which pod belongs to that namespace in `Network Bandwidth` graph in
            `platform-monitoring/Kubernetes/Views/Pods`.
      2. [Optional] Enable NAT Gateway logging if not already enabled. Logging provides more detailed information on
         existing connections. To enable logs update `network.publicNatGateway.logging` value to one of `ERRORS_ONLY`,
         `TRANSLATIONS_ONLY`, `ALL`:

         ```yaml
         network:
           publicNatGateway:
             logging: TRANSLATIONS_ONLY - update to desired logging level
         ```

         See [Configure logging](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/monitoring) for log level explanation.

   2. Cluster Autoscaller is creating an excessive number of VMs. Validate in GCP dashboard, node-pools, metrics
   3. The Cluster grew naturally and more source NAT IPs are required. If above are not causing the issue, validate
      that there is a valid reason for more IPs to be reserved and attached to the NAT Gateway. Look at long-term
      trends of services, node, port allocation growth.

<Callout type="warning">

Allocating more IP addresses might cause source IP changes to existing services for outbound requests. If third party
clients allowlisted specific IPs, they'll need to update their allowlist accordingly.

</Callout>

Increase the number of IPs allocated to NAT Gateway. Update number of IPs in your
`environments/<env_name>/config.yaml` file:

```yaml
network:
  publicNatGateway:
    ipCount: <number of IP's allocated> - increase this value to desired number of IP's
```

Release the change and validate that port utilisation went down below 70%.

2. Do you allocate too many min ports per VM?

   1. Go to Grafana `platform-monitoring/NAT Gateway` dashboard and validate allocated ports per VM against used ports
      per VM. Ensure to extend time span to take into account all traffic spikes. If most of the time ports are being
      allocated but not used you can decrease the `minPortsPerVm` setting in `environments/<env_name>/config.yaml`
      file:

      ```yaml
      network:
        publicNatGateway:
          minPortsPerVm: <min number of ports allocated to single VM> - decrease this value to release ports
      ```

      See [Choose a minimum number of ports per VM](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/tune-nat-configuration#choose-minimum)
      for further details.

   2. If all ports are utilised, check if you
      can [Reduce your port usage](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/troubleshooting#reduce-ports) otherwise increase
      the `ipCount` value (section 1)

<Callout type="warning">

Increasing the number of IPs is a safe operation; the existing connections won't be affected, however, decreasing the
value without draining the connections first will cause connection being terminated immediately.
See [Impact of tuning NAT configurations on existing NAT connections](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/tune-nat-configuration#impact-nat-tuning-existing-conns)
for further details.

</Callout>

### NAT Gateway provisioning/updates failures

```text
Error: Error when reading or editing Address: googleapi: Error 400: External address used for NAT cannot be deleted., badRequest
```

During updates to your `network.publicNatGateway.ipCount` configuration when you try to remove already allocated IP address the
update will fail. To decrease the number of allocated IPs, please drain it first then remove it from NAT Gateway
manually before running IAC tool.
Follow [Decrease allocated number of IP addresses](./nat-gateway#decrease-allocated-number-of-ip-addresses).

### NAT Gateway high error count in logs

NAT Gateway will only log errors related to packet drops because no port was available for NAT. To investigate and
resolve, follow below:

1. Increase the log level to `ALL` (if not already on this level) to get more details about successful connections (see
   if any of errored connections are successful)
2. If high errors count on packets send, check the trend of packet drops per reason in `platform-monitoring/NAT Gateway`
   Grafana dashboard, for
   `OUT_OF_RESOURCES` reason
   follow [Packets dropped with reason: out of resources](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/troubleshooting#insufficient-ports)

<Callout>

We use manual NAT IP address assignment with dynamic port allocation

</Callout>

### NAT Gateway high number of received packet drops

<Callout>

A Cloud NAT gateway drops an ingress data packet if the connection tracking table doesn't contain any entry for the
connection. Those can be due to timeouts or external endpoint trying to establish a connection. Higher number than usual
might not indicate any degradation of any services.

</Callout>

1. Check long window trend of received packet drop rate in `platform-monitoring/NAT Gateway` Grafana dashboard.
   Establish which VM/pod is experiencing the highest drops, then validate it is a genuine failure.
   For genuine failures,
   see [Dropped received packets](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/troubleshooting#cdropped-packets) for hints on how
   to resolve.
