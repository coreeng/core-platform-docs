# Exclude Logs


## Log exclusions

To change log retention or set up [exclusion filters](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/overview#exclusions) configure in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
platformLogging:
  logRetentionDays: 10
  exclusionFilters:
    - name: my-exclusion
      description: Excludes info messages from my-container
      filter: resource.labels.container_name = my-container AND severity = Info
```

Exclusion filters use the Logging [query language](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logging-query-language)

<Callout>

Log entries are excluded after they are received by the Logging API. The number of API calls is not reduced by excluding log entries.
