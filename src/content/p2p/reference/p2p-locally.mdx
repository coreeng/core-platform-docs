# Local development

Some `Makefile` targets within your app require specific variables to successfully execute. Those include registry
details, tenancy or versioning. `Corectl` allows you to export those based on your existing local tenant and repository
configuration. This `corectl` feature is designed to ease local development and enable seamless p2p targets execution.

To construct and print out a list of variables run:

```bash
corectl p2p export --tenant <your_tenant_name> --environment <your_target_env> --repoPath <filepath_to_app_repository>
```

The command will print out all variables as export statements, ex.:

```bash
export BASE_DOMAIN="gcp-dev.cecg.platform.cecg.io" # domain pulled in from environments project
export REPO_PATH="/path/to/my/app/repo" # path to your git local app repository
export REGION="europe-west2" # region pulled in from environments project
export REGISTRY="europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev/myproject/tenant/mytenant" # registry url constructed based on environments project
export VERSION="53b9c85" # short git hash commit pointing to current HEAD (latest commit in currently checked out branch in that repo)
export TENANT_NAME="mytenant"
```

You can copy all the output and paste again in currently running shell to export all envs. Once done you can run most of
the p2p `Makefile` targets without additional configuration.

To export those automatically in the current shell, run:

```bash
eval $(corectl p2p export --tenant <your_tenant_name> --environment <your_target_env> --repoPath <filepath_to_app_repository>)
```

If you omit `-repoPath` flag, the tool will default to current directory.

For further details run:

```bash
corectl p2p export -h
```
