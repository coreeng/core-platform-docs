# Promotion

Promotion is the process of marking an immutable, versioned artifact as being ready for deployment to the next class of environment.

## What is used to promote?

The two main mechanisms for promotion are:

- Tests e.g. functional or non-functional tests
- Stability in an environment e.g. run a longer soak tests in a stage environment and check alerts or canary deployments

Both are possible with the Core Platform P2P, and test based promotion is available out of the box.

## Promotion Mechanism

The Core Platform uses Container Registry artifact copying as the promotion mechanism.

The steps are:

- After Fast Feedback on the main branch `p2p-promote-to-extended-test` is executed
- After Extended Test the `p2p-promote-to-prod` is executed

These steps may be overriden if you want additional or different functionality.
