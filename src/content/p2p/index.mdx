# Path To Production

## Core Platform Path to Production

The P2P enables you to focus on building your business logic and tests without
wasting time on CI/CD tooling setup.
All your custom logic should be added to your Makefile rather than directly in GitHub actions.

All you need to do is implement the steps in the Makefile in your repository and let the Core Platform do everything else.

Not ready to implement a step yet? Just leave it blank!

## Represent change as an Immutable Deployable Versioned Artifact

Regardless of what your change is for production, an application, terraform infrastructure, we build it into an
Immutable Deployable Versioned Artifact, specfically an OCI image and promote it through the stages of the P2P.

### Pipeline as a contract

- The P2P is the contract that every application agrees to adhere to for continuous delivery
- It is _light touch_ in that it doesn't mandate many steps, just the most important types of testing
  - You can use whatever tools you want from each step

## Quality Gates

The P2P consists of the following quality gates:

- Fast Feedback: What you can do in a few minutes
  - Build
    - Unit tests
    - Static Verification
  - Deployed stubbed functional tests
  - Deployed stubbed non-functional tests
  - Deployed integration tests
- Extended Tests
  - Slower tests such as peak load tests
- Once a version has been promoted from Extended tests it is ready for production

Two key concepts for the P2P are:

- [Versioning](./p2p/versioning): The P2P promoted an immutable, versioned artifact through the pipeline
- [Promotion](./p2p/reference/promotion): Each time a quality gate is passed the immutable, versioned artifact is promoted

### P2P Interface: giving you control

Assuming you've started with a software template via corectl you already have a Makefile with the following tasks.
All you need to do is implement them for your application and the P2P will execute them at the right time.

```makefile
p2p-build: ## Build phase
    echo "##### EXECUTING P2P-BUILD #####"

p2p-functional: ## Execute functional tests
    echo "##### EXECUTING P2P-FUNCTIONAL #####"

p2p-nft:  ## Execute non-functional tests
    echo "##### EXECUTING P2P-NFT #####"

p2p-integration:  ## Execute integration tests
    echo "##### EXECUTING P2P-INTEGRATION #####"

p2p-extended-test: ## Runs extended tests
    echo "##### EXECUTING P2P-EXTENDED-TEST #####"

p2p-promote-to-extended-test: ## Promote service to extended test
    echo "##### EXECUTING P2P-PROMOTE-TO-EXTENDED-TEST #####"

p2p-promote-to-prod:  ## Promote service to prod
    echo "##### EXECUTING P2P-PROMOTE-TO-PROD #####"

p2p-prod: ## Runs the service
    echo "##### EXECUTING P2P-PROD #####"

```

These will be the entrypoints of the pipeline. You can then extend these to do your custom actions.

What tool you use in each of the Makefile targets is up to you.

### FAQs

#### What if I don't have tests for one of the stages?

- Leave it as a no-op and as you want to increase your maturity and aim for Continuous Delivery you already have the place to run them
