See capabilities relevant to your role:

- [Platform Operator](#platform-operator-capabilities)
- [Application Developer](#application-developer-capabilities)

## Application Developer Capabilities

A developer capability is one that engineers can do for themselves without the need
to coordinate with infrastructure teams.

- [Application Developer Capabilities](#application-developer-capabilities)
  - [Full Application Environments](#full-application-environments)
  - [Pipelines](#pipelines)
  - [OCI Registries as a service](#oci-registries-as-a-service)
  - [Exposing a service (TLS)](#exposing-a-service-tls)
  - [Application blueprints](#application-blueprints)
  - [Aggregated Monitoring](#aggregated-monitoring)
  - [Hosted dashboards](#hosted-dashboards)
  - [Secure Secrets](#secure-secrets)
  - [Access infrastructure](#access-infrastructure)
- [Platform Operator Capabilities](#platform-operator-capabilities)
  - [Full Infrastructure Environments](#full-infrastructure-environments)
  - [Fully Private Infrastructure](#fully-private-infrastructure)

### Full Application Environments

- Self-service request for a full set of environments for a new service
- Get additional environments for an existing service e.g. to do additional testing

See:

- [Tenancy](/app/tenancy/) for how to onboard onto the platform and get environments

### Pipelines

- Continuous Delivery ready pipelines come out of the box with stages for all types of testing
  and promotion through environments all the way to production.
- Passwordless authentication from pipelines into environments

See:

- [Deploying an app](/app/overview)
- [Path to Production](/p2p/overview) for reference on each stage of the path to production
- [New application](/app/new-app/) for **automatic** repo, pipeline and app templating

### OCI Registries as a service

- Environments come with highly available registries local to each environment

### Exposing a service (TLS)

- Self-service ability to expose services to the Internet with automatic TLS.

### Application blueprints

- New application in seconds with built-in templates for key languages
- Ability to define your own templates for your engineering organisation.

See:

- [Templates](/reference/software-templates/) for application blueprints

### Aggregated Monitoring

- Logs automatically collected for all your application instances and searchable in once place
- Key performance metrics collected out of the box and the ability to define custom metrics collection
- Ability to deploy a per tenant monitoring stack

See:

- [Application Monitoring](/app/app-monitoring)
- [Logs](/app/logs)

### Hosted dashboards

- Deploy dashboards as configuration and deploy them as part of the P2P

See:

- [Application Monitoring](/app/app-monitoring/)

### Secure Secrets

- Ability to deploy secrets to all environments and access from your application

See:

- [Secrets](/app/secrets)

### Access infrastructure

- Provision infrastructure, e.g. cloud databases and caches, and connect securely from the platform

See:

- [Accessing Cloud Infrastructure](/reference/accessing-cloud-infra/)

## Platform Operator Capabilities

### Full Infrastructure Environments

A full set of environments to reliably deploy new versions of the platform without affecting
application developers (tenants).

### Fully Private Infrastructure

- All infrastructure is private with CLI for creating a encrypted tunnel to connect to from workstations
