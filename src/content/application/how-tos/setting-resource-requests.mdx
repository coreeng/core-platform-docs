# Setting resource requests

<Callout type="warning">Setting a low memory limit can lead to Out Of Memory kills of your application.</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Setting resource requests can prevent Out of Memory (OOM) and CPU throttling for your workloads. It's usually best to
  not set CPU limits. See [memory vs cpu](/reference/resources) for more details.
